Hey, my name is Theo and I've been a professional software developer for over 9 years now, and I'm loving being a journeyman software developer. My current adventure is [The Coding Ground](http://www.thecodingground.com), and, together with Mandla and Jason, we are aiming to make a significant difference in our country's unemployment problem as well as helping individuals to change their lives.

Give me a shout at theo@codeitright.co.za to get into contact, or contact me on my social media platforms below.
